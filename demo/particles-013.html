    <h4>Test purpose</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Build a Christmas scene from a Shape entity and a Phrase entity along a quadratic line.</li>
      <li>Add an point emitter to the top of the tree (positioned along its path - the stars should float upwards, shrink and fade as they age.</li>
      <li>Add an area emitter to the tree Shape - these stars should very slowly fade in, then grow bigger (by updating one of the Star entity's radius attributes), then shrink and fade to the end of its life.</li>
      <li>Create a new Cell. In the cell setup a mini-scene consisting of a candle and its flame. The flame is a point emitter which also uses a blur filter.</li>
      <li>Create ten Picture entitys that use the Cell as their asset, and add them to the scene; these should use the tree entity's path to determine their position</li>
    </ul>
