  <h2>Fullscreen API functionality</h2>
  <h3>Press the enter/return key to toggle canvas into/out of full screen display mode</h3>

  <div class="canvas-container">
    <canvas 
      id="canvas-1"

    <h4>Test purpose</h4>
    <p>Create a keyboard-mediated User Interaction to make the canvas element fullscreen</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The test creates the same functionality as described in <a href="../docs/demo/canvas-005.html">Demo Canvas-005</a>.</li>
      <li>Press the return key to expand the canvas into fullscreen mode</li>
      <li>The canvas should not flicker as it transitions to fill the screen; once in fullscreen mode the animation should continue as before</li>
      <li>The top and bottom Block and Wheel entitys should not change size or shape as they have absolute dimensions; the middle entitys should shange shape/size as they have relative dimensions</li>
      <li>All entitys should maintain their positioning within the scene in relation to each other, as they all have relative positioning</li>
      <li>Check that the mouse cursor changes as expected when hovered over an entity</li>
      <li>Check that all entitys can be dragged as expected, and the Block with the animated gradient responds as expected when dragged</li>
      <li>Press the return key to deflate the canvas back into its position in the web page; note that the esc key should also invoke this action</li>
      <li>Repeat position, size, UI and animation checks</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>Touch test:</b> should work as expected</p>
