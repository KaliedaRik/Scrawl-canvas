  <h1><a href="index.html">Scrawl-canvas v8</a> - Canvas test 009</h1>
  <h2>Pattern styles; Entity web link anchors; Dynamic accessibility</h2>
  <h3>Move cursor over canvas, or use keyboard tab,<br />to see dynamic hover and accessibility functionality<br />Click (or press keyboard enter) on a highlighted entity<br />to open a new web page</h3>

  <canvas 
    id="mycanvas" 
    width="600" 
    height="400"
    data-scrawl-canvas
  ></canvas>

  <p id="reportmessage"></p>

  <div class="testinfo">
    <h4>Test purpose</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Create/clone various Pattern styles, using DOM images, and loading images</li>
      <li>Create/clone Block entitys to use the Patterns</li>
      <li>Create a new cell and add it to the canvas</li>
      <li>Animate a pattern-filled block in the new cell</li>
      <li>Use the new cell as the source for a Pattern style</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Additionally, using this demo to check zoned canvas User Interactions</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Define onEnter and onLeave functions on the first defined block, to change its linewidth attribute when the mouse cursor hovers over it</li>
      <li>Define anchor objects for each entity, and functionality to action mouse clicks on them</li>
      <li>Check that the 'on...' functions, and the anchor, successfully clone-and-adapt to the other block entitys</li>
      <li>Check that the functionality works by moving the cursor over and away from the blocks</li>
      <li>Check that clicking on an entity results in an appropriate Wikipedia page opening in a new browser tab</li>
      <li>Check that the functionality works using keyboard tabbing and enter (for accessibility)</li>
      <li>Check that the canvas's title (used in its tool prompt) adapts appropriately as user moves between Blocks</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Tracking User Interactions</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add Google Analytics (analytics_debug.js) to the page; create a 'ga' object and tracker</li>
      <li>Adapt the 'on...' functions to trigger tailored analytics messages as user focuses and blurs across the Block entitys</li>
      <li>Adapt the anchor so that it, too, sends a tailored analytics message when the link is invoked</li>
      <li>Check that the tracking functionality works as expected, both for mouse/touch interactions and for keyboard interactions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Kill and resurrect</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Kill and resurrect a Block entity to make sure it removes itself entirely from the Scrawl-canvas system, and cleanly recreate itself from saved packet, and that full functionality - including analytics tracking - can be re-applied to it</li>
      <li>Kill and resurrect a Pattern style to make sure it removes itself entirely from the Scrawl-canvas system, and cleanly recreate itself from saved packet</li>
    </ul>

    <p><b>To note:</b> this test runs very slowly on Chrome-based browsers, but as expected on Firefox/Safari. The issue is entirely around the canvas context drawImage() function - in Chrome, if the source and destination canvas/contexts are of different sizes such that one gets stored in in CPU and the other in GPU then the speed of the drawImage copy gets badly degraded. A workaround would be to consider the sizes of any non-base Cells used in the demo and recode them accordingly. We're keeping this bug in the demo code for now, in the hope that one day Chrome devs find a better fix for this issue.</p>

    <p><b>Touch test:</b> should work as expected - but dragging a finger from one block to another may lead to web page navigation being blocked by browser</p>
