  <h1>Welcome to the Scrawl-canvas code base</h1>

  <p>Scrawl-canvas is a JavaScript library for working with the HTML5 &lt;canvas> element. The library:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Automatically discovers existing &lt;canvas> elements in a web page.</li>
    <li>Can add new &lt;canvas> elements to the web page.</li>
    <li>Defines a set of factory functions for creating a wide range of graphic artefacts and effects, which can be drawn on a canvas.</li>
    <li>Includes an adaptable - yet easy to use - protocol for positioning, displaying and animating artefacts and effects across the canvas.</li>
    <li>Adds functionality to make &lt;canvas> elements responsive, adapting their size according to their surrounding environment.</li>
    <li>Makes the canvas both accessible, and interactive - including the ability to easily track user interactions with different parts of the canvas.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These test demos and documentation are for <b>Scrawl-canvas v8.12.0</b></p>
